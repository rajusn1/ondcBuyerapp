# ondcBuyerapp


This App is a proof of Concept for ONDC Buyer App where a customer can place a order from a kirana store registered on 
ONDC Platform. The items can be added to cart and based on the Supplier and the stock availabilty we can check out and purchase,
 the app will also use the logistics deliver team that will be added for delivery by the kirana store. 
 
 The payment gateway will be integrated with the ONDC Payment gateway companies or any bank that we add to get the banking
 in place for the transaction
