# ondcBuyerapp
This App is a proof of Concept for ONDC Buyer App where a customer can place a order from a kirana store registered on ONDC Platform. The items can be added to cart and based on the Supplier and the stock availabilty we can check out and purchase, the app will also use the logistics deliver team that will be added for delivery by the kirana store.
